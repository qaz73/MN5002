    "This is just a short example of the power of the projection using Tensorflow Projector. Word vectors were created using [this example from Google Tensorflow](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/text/word2vec.ipynb#scrollTo=aj--8RFK6fgW) run in Colab. This works with word vectors based [the works of Shakespeare](https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/data/shakespeare.txt)\n",

    "The example created the two files\n",
    "* **vectors.tsv** , word token vectors created using word2vec - roughly **6 MB** in size\n",
    "* **metadata.tsv** , metadata describing the vectors (e.g., the text of the word associated with the vector) - roughly **30 kB** in size\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these files are provided in the Gitlab directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the two files to your own storage (local or Google drive).\n",
    "1. In your browser, open [Tensorflow Projector](http://projector.tensorflow.org/).\n",
    "1. On the upper left of the browser, click the **Load** icon\n",
    "1. This will ask you to upload the two files **vectors.tsv** and **metadata.tsv** that you had downloaded\n",
    "1. Now you can play with the various projections, including **UMAP**, **PCA** and **t-SNE**, to get an understanding about the associations between the words."
